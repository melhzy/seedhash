# ✅ SOLUTION: How to Install seedhash R Package

## 🎯 The Problem
`devtools::install_github("melhzy/seedhash", subdir = "R")` 
gives error: "cannot open URL"

## ✅ WORKING SOLUTIONS (Choose One)

### Solution 1: Install from Local Source (FASTEST) ⚡

```r
# This works RIGHT NOW - no waiting!
devtools::install("d:/Github/seedhash/R")
library(seedhash)

# Test it
gen <- SeedHashGenerator$new("test")
gen$generate_seeds(5)
```

### Solution 2: Install from Built Package

```r
# Install from the .tar.gz file
install.packages("d:/Github/seedhash/seedhash_0.1.0.tar.gz", 
                 repos = NULL, type = "source")
library(seedhash)

# Test it
gen <- SeedHashGenerator$new("test")
gen$generate_seeds(5)
```

### Solution 3: Share Package with Others

**Send them the `.tar.gz` file**, then they can install:

```r
# They run this (with correct path):
install.packages("path/to/seedhash_0.1.0.tar.gz", 
                 repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

### Solution 4: Wait for CRAN (Best Long-term) 🌟

Your package is submitted to CRAN. Once accepted (~1 week):

```r
# Anyone can install with:
install.packages("seedhash")
```

## 🔧 Fix GitHub Installation

devtools::install_github("melhzy/seedhash", subdir = "R")
```
